Absolutely! Here's your fully updated **prompt** that uses **ImgBB** for image hosting and **EmailJS** for sending download links — beautifully wrapped in Ghibli-style design language:

---

Design a **magical, Studio Ghibli-inspired homepage** as a **fully frontend-only website** that allows users to upload up to **3 personal images** and enter their **email address** to request a **Ghibli-style transformation**. The entire page should feel like it belongs in a Ghibli film — featuring soft gradients, nature-inspired color palettes (sky blues, forest greens, sunset golds), rounded edges, fantasy-style typography, and gentle animations like drifting clouds or floating sparkles. Use **Tailwind CSS** for layout and styling, and **Google Fonts** such as *Marck Script*, *Merriweather*, or *Dancing Script* for a warm, storybook vibe.

---

### 💫 Content and Layout:

- The main title should read:  
  **“Transform Into Ghibli Magic”**  
  Styled in a soft, fantasy font.

- Under the header, add this poetic tagline:  
  *“Send us your photos, and we’ll paint your story in Ghibli light.”*

- The form should include:
  - An image upload input that accepts up to **3 JPG/PNG images**
  - An **email input** field
  - A whimsical CTA button labeled:  
    **“Send to the Ghibli Spirits”**

---

### ☁️ Image Hosting via ImgBB:

- Upload each image to **[ImgBB](https://api.imgbb.com/)** using their API.
- Use this **API Key**: `4e5c1e7f6e82e9231f24cb11924550a6`
- For each uploaded image, extract the `display_url` and store them for use in the email.

---

### ✉️ Email Sending via EmailJS:

- Use **EmailJS** to send the uploaded image links and user email to your inbox.
- Use the following credentials:
  - **Service ID**: `service_s4psi1r`
  - **Template ID**: `template_lhlm4bu`
  - **Public Key**: `TqyzrqwQT23rqZp2f`
- The email template should include:
  - `user_email`
  - `image_link_1`, `image_link_2`, `image_link_3` (with empty string fallback)

---

### ✅ Submission Behavior:

- Validate that the user uploads **1 to 3 images** and provides a valid email.
- Upload the images to ImgBB and get their hosted URLs.
- Send the image URLs and email address to your predefined inbox via EmailJS.
- Display a magical success message like:  
  *“All set! The Ghibli spirits are working on your transformation.”*

---

### 📜 Footer and Disclaimer:

- Show a subtle, center-aligned disclaimer beneath the form:  
  *“We don’t store your images. Delivery will be done in a couple of hours.”*

- Add a soft footer at the bottom of the page with the line:  
  **© 2025 Made by AP**  
  Use Ghibli-appropriate font and styling.
